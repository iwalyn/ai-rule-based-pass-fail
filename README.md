# Python Learning – Rule-Based AI System

## Project Description
This project implements a rule-based artificial intelligence system to predict whether a student will pass a Python course exam based on their learning habits and engagement metrics.

The study is conducted as part of a university-level Artificial Intelligence course assignment.

---

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is **Python Learning & Exam Performance Dataset**, which contains simulated learning activity data from 3,000 students.

The dataset includes:
- Weekly study hours
- Number of solved practice problems
- Completed projects
- Engagement and learning behavior metrics
- Final exam result (pass/fail)

The dataset is synthetic and does not include any real student information.

---

## Methodology
A **rule-based decision system** was designed using predefined conditions based on student learning behaviors.

The system follows a simple decision logic:
- Students who meet minimum thresholds for study time, practice, and project completion are classified as **Pass**
- Otherwise, students are classified as **Fail**

This approach aligns with classical artificial intelligence concepts such as rule-based systems and intelligent agents.

## Performance Evaluation
System performance is evaluated by comparing predicted results with actual exam outcomes using the following metrics:
- Accuracy
- Error Rate

## Notes
This project does not use machine learning libraries or model training techniques.  
All decisions are made using rule-based logic to ensure compatibility with the course curriculum.
